# usage_analysis_adnmb
This repo is currently in use for creating dashboard and report for adnmb.com.

Currently, adnmb tried to protect its website from being scraped and only allow user without account to view maximum 100 pages in each thread. So content in threads after 2018-04-18 will be missing if the maximum page is greater than 100 pages.

To solve this problem, one should apply for an account with cellphone.
